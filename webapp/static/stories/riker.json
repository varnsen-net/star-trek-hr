'I have come to request your assistance in an ongoing investigation regarding potential misconduct during recent recreational poker games.' \n\nDr. Crusher raised an eyebrow, 'Misconduct? In a poker game? This sounds serious. What do you need from me?' \n\nData explained the situation, detailing his observations and the initial evidence he gathered. 'I seek any personal logs or recordings you may have made during the poker games, particularly on Stardate 41987.3. Your logs could provide additional insights or evidence.' \n\nDr. Crusher's expression turned thoughtful. 'I believe I do have some personal logs from those sessions. We often review them for fun\u2014poker nights are a bit of a tradition, after all.' She walked over to a console and began accessing her personal storage. After a few moments, she extracted a data chip and handed it to Data. 'Here are the recordings. I hope they help.' \n\nData accepted the data chip with gratitude. 'Your cooperation is greatly appreciated, Doctor. This will significantly aid in substantiating the evidence.' \n\nDr. Crusher nodded, the seriousness of the situation beginning to dawn on her. 'I hope this gets resolved fairly, Data. If you need any more help, don't hesitate to ask.' \n\nData secured the data chip within his uniform. With tangible evidence now in hand, the next step was clear: analyzing the recordings for any inconsistencies or signs of cheating. He turned to leave Sickbay, focused and resolute.

Please indicate your choice below.\",\"choice_0\":\"Schedule a formal deposition\"}This is the story leading to the current panel: 'In the dimly lit corridors of the USS Enterprise, Lt. Commander Data found himself pondering an anomaly that, by all means, should not exist in his hyper-logical world. Poker\u2014an ancient Earth game, steeped in strategy, deception, and, apparently, dishonesty. As he processed his latest loss at the hands of Commander Riker, a troubling realization crystallized: Riker was cheating. Methodically, Data decided to take action the only way his ethical subroutines would allow\u2014by filing an official complaint with Human Resources. The journey to unmask the secret behind Riker's deceit would not be straightforward, but for now, Data needed the correct forms. How will Data begin this critical process? Data approached Counselor Troi's quarters with his characteristic mechanical precision. Given her expertise in human psychology, Troi would provide invaluable insight into navigating the complexities of Human Resources. As the doors slid open, Data offered a polite nod. 'Counselor, I require your assistance in a delicate matter involving improper conduct during recreational activities.' Troi, sensing Data\u2019s seriousness, motioned for him to sit. 'Please, elaborate, Data.' He went on to explain his observations and suspicions regarding Commander Riker's poker game tactics. Troi listened carefully, her face a mask of concern and intrigue. 'This process will require you to fill multiple forms and gather evidence. I\u2019ll guide you through the first steps.' Data nodded, feeling a small measure of relief. Counselor Troi's eyes narrowed slightly as she pondered Data's question. 'Having a witness would indeed strengthen your case, Data. However, the Human Resources procedures allow for complaints to be filed based solely on circumstantial evidence if the issue involves recreational activities. Still, I would recommend finding someone who can support your claims. Do you have anyone in mind?' Data's internal processors flicked through various possibilities. Dr. Beverly Crusher had also been present at several of the poker games where the alleged cheating took place. Should he enlist her as a witness? Counselor Troi interrupted his thoughts, 'Also, make sure to gather as much physical evidence as possible. Logs, recordings, anything that can support your observations.' Data considered Counselor Troi's advice, his internal circuits processing the limited social repercussion scenarios associated with each potential witness. 'Counselor, your presence and professional insight would be immensely beneficial. Would you be willing to serve as my witness in this endeavor?' Troi studied Data for a moment before nodding. 'Of course, Data. However, there's formal procedure we need to follow. We'll start by filling Form 37-B, 'Request for Witness in HR Proceedings.' I\u2019ll help you complete the required sections. After that, you'll need to log your observations in the Incident Report Form 42-C.' As Troi retrieved the necessary forms from her console, Data reviewed the checklist in his mind, his resolve to see justice served growing stronger. 'Let\u2019s proceed,' he announced, ready to delve into the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the Enterprise's HR department. Troi handed him the forms and a stylus. 'We\u2019ll start with the basic information. Please provide your Starfleet identification number and detailed accounts of the events.' Data picked up the stylus, his steady hand programmed for precision. He began to meticulously fill out his Starfleet ID: LC-DTA-47634. Each number and letter was committed to memory, verified and cross-checked within milliseconds. Counselor Troi watched as Data began to write, sensing that this was just the beginning of a much larger issue. 'Start by detailing the poker game incidents,' she advised, her tone patient. Data complied, describing the sequence of events with exactitude: the cards dealt, the bets placed, and the subtle gestures he'd observed that suggested Riker's underhanded tactics. 'The first game in question occurred in the Officers' Lounge on Stardate 41987.3,' Data began. 'As the game progressed, I noted an irregularity in the distribution of winning hands. Commander's Riker's facial micro-expressions and hand movements were consistent with deceptive practices utilized to manipulate card outcomes.' Troi interjected gently, 'Describe the specific tactics you believe he used.' Data paused, recalibrating his thoughts before continuing, 'I suspect Commander Riker was employing sleight-of-hand techniques, possibly aided by concealed devices. The pattern of wins was statistically improbable.' With the first section of the form filled, Data paused, awaiting Counselor Troi's next instructions. Troi glanced over the form, nodding in approval. 'Now, the form requires a secondary verification. Would you like to encode a personal access code for document integrity, request a biometric scan, or proceed with a digital signature verification?' Data pressed his thumb against the biometric scanner, feeling a faint hum as it processed his unique synthetic imprint. Counselor Troi watched as the scanner confirmed his identity with a soft beep. 'Verification complete,' she announced, her voice carrying a note of encouragement. 'Now that we have authenticated your identity, we need to focus on gathering tangible evidence to support your claim. Do you have access to the security logs or surveillance footage of the game in question?' Data's positronic brain quickly accessed the ship's database, searching for relevant footage. 'The security logs are accessible, but high-definition surveillance was limited in the Officers' Lounge during the specified time.' Troi nodded thoughtfully, 'In that case, you may need to obtain personal logs or covert recordings. I would suggest checking if any of the participants recorded the game for review or acquisition of additional insight.' With the preliminary forms completed, Data felt the weight of his task. It was time to gather concrete evidence. The truth, elusive yet within reach, beckoned him forward. 'Thank you, Counselor. I will proceed to secure any extant records.' As he rose, Troi gave a reassuring smile, 'Remember Data, integrity in every step. Be thorough.' Data headed to the Operations Center to begin his search for recordings that could unravel the calculated deception by Commander Riker. Data made his way to the Operations Center, the echo of his precise footsteps reverberating through the metallic halls. Upon arrival, he approached the duty officer with efficient determination. 'Ensign, I require access to security footage from the Officers' Lounge on Stardate 41987.3 for an ongoing investigation.' The ensign, caught off guard by the gravity in Data's usually composed demeanor, quickly keyed in the command. The monitor blinked, and a series of timestamps appeared on the screen. 'Access granted, sir,' the ensign reported. Data nodded and began reviewing the footage with meticulous attention to detail. The grainy video revealed the poker game fragment by fragment, each player\u2019s motions captured but often obscured by the low resolution. Despite the limitations, Data focused intently on Riker\u2019s movements, seeking any anomalies. Half an hour elapsed before Data found what he was looking for: a subtle, almost imperceptible sleight of hand that caused a card to vanish and reappear. He paused the footage and magnified the frame, saving the segment to his personal data storage for further analysis. The next step, as Counselor Troi advised, was to cross-reference this initial evidence with personal logs from the participants. Data decided to check if Dr. Beverly Crusher had recorded any of the games. Data navigated his way to Engineering with single-minded determination. As he entered, the familiar hum of the warp core surrounded him, providing a momentary sense of reassurance. He quickly located Commander Geordi La Forge, who was engrossed in calibrating a console. 'Commander La Forge,' Data began, 'I require your technical assistance for an ongoing investigation.' Geordi looked up, noting the serious tone in Data\u2019s voice. 'What do you need, Data?' he asked, curiosity piqued. 'I have obtained security footage from the poker game in the Officers' Lounge on Stardate 41987.3. However, the resolution is insufficient to clearly identify the suspected sleight-of-hand techniques employed by Commander Riker. I need your expertise in enhancing this footage to uncover any irregularities.' Geordi nodded, intrigued. 'Alright, let's see what we can do.' The two officers moved to a nearby workstation. Data connected his personal data storage, and the screen displayed the paused footage. Geordi began typing commands, enhancing the pixels and resolution, frame by frame. After several minutes, the unclear movements in the original video started to become sharper and more distinct. Geordi leaned back, scrutinizing the altered footage. 'There it is,' he said, pointing to a frame where Riker's hand appeared to manipulate a card in a way that defied the usual rules of physics. 'It seems you were right, Data.'

'Everything seems to be in order,' he announced, taking a stamp and marking the form with a seal of approval. 'You may now proceed to Meeting Room 2, where an HR officer will be ready to discuss your case.' \n\nData nodded, taking the stamped form and making his way to Meeting Room 2. The room was dimly lit, echoing much of the atmospheric mystery he had encountered throughout his investigation. Inside, HR Officer Connelly waited, a stern expression on her face. 'Please, take a seat, Lieutenant Data. I have reviewed your initial submission,' she gestured to a screen beside her displaying Data's detailed report and the enhanced video footage. 'Your accusations against Commander Riker are serious. We need to ensure everything follows protocol.' \n\nData took a seat, his yellow eyes focusing intently on Officer Connelly. 'I aim to ensure justice is served. I have no desire to tarnish Commander Riker's reputation unjustly.' \n\nConnelly's gaze softened slightly. 'Understood, Lieutenant. Now, we need to go over some finer details. Do you have any knowledge of Commander Riker's personal motives or any previous incidents that might provide context to these accusations?' \n",

        "paragraph_text": "Data's yellow eyes flickered momentarily as he recalled various poker games and the subtle but consistent anomalies in Riker's behavior. 'During the poker games,' Data began, 'I observed that Commander Riker would often engage in friendly banter and use his commanding presence to dominate the table. However, these interactions were accompanied by a pattern of unusual hand movements and micro-expressions that suggested he was manipulating the outcomes. I suspect his personal motivations included maintaining his status as the best player on the ship.' Officer Connelly nodded thoughtfully, jotting down notes. 'I see. These details will be crucial for our investigation. Now, Lieutenant, there's one final form we must complete to officially log your complaint and begin the formal investigation.' She handed Data Form 112-X, 'Final Submission for Formal Investigation.' Taking the form, Data meticulously filled in each section, ensuring every detail was precise. As he handed the form back to Officer Connelly, she gave a small approving nod. 'Everything appears to be in order. We will now proceed with logging your complaint.' Connelly entered Data's details into the HR system. As she pressed the final key, a soft hum came from the console, but it quickly escalated into a piercing alarm. Data's eyes widened imperceptibly. 'Warning: System Overload \u2013 Unauthorized Form Detected,' the computer intoned with increasing urgency. Data\u2019s positronic brain raced to comprehend the error. 'It appears I have submitted the incorrect form,' he realized too late. The entire ship shook violently as the system malfunction triggered a catastrophic chain reaction. Sparks flew from every console, and the corridors filled with blaring alarms. Officer Connelly's face twisted in horror. 'Abort submission!' she screamed, but it was beyond salvaging. In a matter of seconds, the USS Enterprise was no more. The ship exploded into a brilliant flash of light, leaving nothing but silence in the void of space.",

'There have been instances where crew members discussed Commander Riker's extraordinary luck at games of chance. These comments, while anecdotal, have been persistent enough to warrant consideration.' Officer Connelly nodded, making notes. 'Thank you, Lieutenant Data. We will take this into account.' She paused, flipping through the paperwork. 'Hm, it seems we have a minor issue with your submission.' Data\u2019s brow furrowed in synthetic concern. 'Issue? Please specify.' The HR officer sighed. 'It appears you\u2019ve filled out Form 89-Q instead of 89-P, 'Request for Preliminary Investigation.' This bureaucratic error may very well invalidate your entire complaint unless corrected immediately.' Data\u2019s internal processors rapidly reassessed the situation, his mind racing against the clock.\n\n'Understood, I will rectify this error post-haste,' he affirmed. Yet, even with his remarkable speed, the consequences had already been set in motion. The automated system, upon detecting the incorrect form, triggered a cascading sequence of overrides in the Enterprise's main computer, misinterpreting the error as a critical security breach. Alarms blared throughout the ship, red lights flashing ominously.\n\n'Warning: Self-Destruct Sequence Initiated,' the ship\u2019s computer intoned.\n\nPanic spread among the crew, their training and discipline momentarily overwhelmed by the surge of chaos. Data attempted to intervene, only to find the security parameters sealed tighter than an airlock.\n\n'Decompression Protocol Active. Evacuate Ship Immediately,' the computer\u2019s calm yet merciless voice echoed.\n\nIn the midst of the frenzy, Officer Connelly looked at Data with wide eyes. 'It\u2019s too late, Data. The system won\u2019t allow manual input once the sequence is activated.' Data stepped back, his logic circuits unable to comprehend the impending doom from such a trivial mistake. As the countdown neared its final seconds, he did the only thing left: he watched.\n\nThe USS Enterprise exploded into a brilliant inferno, a tragic testament to the dangers inherent in human\u2014and synthetic\u2014fallibility. And so, one misfiled form led to the unthinkable, a dark swan song for the flagship of the Federation.",
