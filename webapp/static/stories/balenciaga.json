Streamlined individuality! Ubiquitous brand recognition! We will be the envy of the quadrant!\" As Picard advances, his Balenciaga acolytes begin to chant louder, their voices reaching a fever pitch. \"Balenciaga! Balenciaga! Balenciaga!\" Suddenly, a red alert klaxon blares throughout the ship, momentarily drowning out the chanting. A voice, strained and panicked, crackles over the intercom. \"Captain! We have a breach in the warp core! It's... unstable!\" Picard pauses, his vacant eyes momentarily flickering with something akin to his old self. \"Damage report!\" he barks, but the distortion quickly returns. \"Never mind. Red Alert is so last season.\" He turns back to you, his gaze intense. \"Now, HR. Make your choice.\" But your words have doomed them all. The warp core, already destabilized, cannot handle the sudden surge in energy demands caused by replicators creating mountains of pre-distressed Balenciaga garments. With a blinding flash and a deafening roar, the Enterprise is torn apart, atomized into the cold vacuum of space, another victim of HR protocol. The last transmission is from Counselor Troi. \"I told you there was no time for forms!\"",

Diversity and inclusion?\" he stammers, the words sounding alien and archaic in the high-fashion dystopia. He glances around at the assembled Balenciaga officers, their faces blank and unreadable. \"I... I don't know. Demna didn't mention anything about... unions.\" The chanting falters, a ripple of uncertainty passing through the crowd. Worf, still struggling to maintain his pose in the platform Crocs, nearly topples over. Crusher adjusts her safety-pin-secured garments, a look of mild concern creasing her brow. Picard sways, caught between the allure of high fashion and the lingering vestiges of Starfleet protocol. He clutches his head, a pained expression contorting his face. \"Forms... policies... HR...\" he whispers, the words barely audible above the fading chant. Then, with a sudden burst of clarity, he throws the Balenciaga pen to the ground and shouts, \"Run, HR! Run while you still can! Before they make you wear the... the sock shoes!\"",

Bio-contamination?\" he spits, the words laced with a venom that seems wholly unnatural. He tears at the oversized hoodie, revealing a Starfleet uniform underneath, now contorted and warped into a grotesque parody of high fashion. \"Don't you understand? This is about transcending the mundane! About embracing the avant-garde! Your rules, your regulations... they mean nothing!\" He raises his hands, his voice rising to a crescendo. \"We are the future of fashion! And you, HR, are nothing but a... a fashion victim!\" With a final, desperate cry of \"Balenciaga!\", Picard lunges forward. As Picard lunges, the Balenciaga officers surge to action, surrounding you, their chanting growing louder, more insistent. The ship begins to shake, the minimalist concrete walls cracking and crumbling. Alarms blare, but they are drowned out by the rhythmic drone of \"Balenciaga... Balenciaga...\" Outside, the Enterprise strains against some unknown force, its sleek hull groaning and twisting. The power converters overload, sending sparks flying. The last thing you see is Troi, a single tear rolling down her cheek, as the Enterprise explodes in a blinding flash of haute couture and antimatter annihilation.",

But don't say I didn't warn you.\" He grabs the discarded Balenciaga pen, his hand trembling, and scrawls a barely legible 'JLP' on the imaginary dotted line you've indicated in the air. As he does so, the chanting resumes, louder and more insistent than before. The Balenciaga officers surge forward, their vacant eyes burning with a newfound fervor. The walls begin to pulsate, the 'B' logos glowing with an eerie light. Troi screams, a piercing sound that is quickly drowned out by the rising tide of high-fashion madness. Picard, his face now completely devoid of emotion, turns to you, a strange smile playing on his lips. \"Thank you, HR,\" he whispers. \"You have ensured our... complete transformation.\" Suddenly, a deafening roar echoes through the ship. The walls crack, the floor buckles, and the Enterprise lurches violently. Alarms blare, red lights flash, and the scent of burning plastic fills the air. The ship has begun to tear itself apart. As the Enterprise is consumed by an implosion of terrible taste, a final message flashes across your console: 'POLICY UPDATE REQUIRED: MANDATORY BALENCIAGA COMPLIANCE'. You smile, knowing that even in the face of total annihilation, Human Resources has upheld its sacred duty. The End.",

For the love of Gene Roddenberry, just burn it!\" He collapses to his knees, clutching his head as the chanting swells once more. The Balenciaga officers, momentarily stunned by Picard's outburst, begin to stir, their vacant eyes focusing on you with renewed intensity.

Crusher advances, her safety pin glinting menacingly. Picard, writhing on the floor, manages to croak out one final warning: \"The... the platform Crocs... they're... they're not ironic!\" But it's too late. Ignoring Troi's screams and Picard's final, fashion-related warning, you calmly retrieve a PADD from your satchel. \"Now, Counselor,\" you say, your voice unwavering, \"if you could just fill out sections A through G...\" As you extend the PADD, a safety pin pierces your hand. You barely register the pain, your focus solely on proper procedure. Meanwhile, the Balenciaga officers converge, their chanting growing louder, more frenzied. The sound resonates through the ship, reaching every deck, every corridor. The Enterprise, once a symbol of exploration and diplomacy, begins to vibrate, the structure buckling under the immense pressure of high fashion. The warp core, unable to withstand the destabilizing force of so much avant-garde energy, overloads. A blinding flash engulfs Deck 12, then the entire ship. In the cold vacuum of space, the USS Enterprise, and all its Balenciaga-clad inhabitants, is reduced to a cloud of cosmic dust, a testament to the unwavering power of HR protocol. And somewhere, among the debris, a lone PADD floats, still displaying Form 342-Alpha, incomplete.",

Picard, still kneeling on the ground, looks up at you with a mixture of desperation and resignation. \"HR, please! There's no time for... paperwork! Just go!\" Worf lunges, attempting to trip you with an expertly placed platform Croc. Crusher brandishes her safety pin with menacing precision. Troi, realizing the futility of arguing, grabs your hand and drags you towards the turbolift. \"Fine! Insurance later! Survival now!\" As the doors slide shut, sealing you inside the relative safety of the turbolift, you catch a glimpse of Picard, now fully re-assimilated, leading the Balenciaga officers in a synchronized runway walk. The turbolift lurches into motion, ascending rapidly. Troi leans against the wall, gasping for breath. \"Where to?\" she asks, her voice strained. Before you can answer, a deafening explosion rocks the turbolift, throwing you both to the floor. The lights flicker and die, plunging you into darkness. The turbolift screeches to a halt, shuddering violently. A computerized voice announces, \"Warning: Warp core breach imminent. Evacuate immediately.\" Troi struggles to her feet, her face pale in the emergency lighting. \"The warp core! They must have destabilized it during their\u2026 their fashion show!\" Another explosion rocks the ship, more violent than the last. Metal groans and screams as the Enterprise begins to tear itself apart. Your dedication to HR protocol has doomed the ship. As the turbolift doors creak open, revealing a corridor engulfed in flames, you realize the horrifying truth: the Enterprise, a symbol of hope and exploration, is about to be destroyed\u2026 all because you insisted on filing the proper paperwork. The last thing you see is Troi's horrified face before the darkness consumes you both. The Enterprise explodes, a supernova of bad taste and bureaucratic inertia.",
