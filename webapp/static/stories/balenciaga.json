You step into the ready room, and Picard gestures for you to take a seat. Once the door securely closes, you hand over the formal complaint. Picard takes it, briefly scanning the contents before looking up with a grave expression. \"Balenciaga attire among senior officers? This is indeed highly irregular, Lieutenant.

This malware, activated by your unauthorized access, propagated through the ship's critical systems unchecked. As the realization dawns, the final seconds tick down.
